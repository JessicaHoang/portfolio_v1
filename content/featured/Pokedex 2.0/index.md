Pokdex 2.0 is a Pokemon encyclopedia to look up your favorite Pokemon. It was created using Next.js 14, Framer motion, and Tailwind CSS. It includes a load spinner for infinite scrolling.The Pokemons are fetched from Poke API. It makes looking up Pokemons easy with the
search bar implementation. Framer motion adds animation to the card; it allows the cards to scales up when hovered over and flips around when clicked on.
